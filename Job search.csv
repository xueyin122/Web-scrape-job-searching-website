These projects require the ability to work closely with clients and prominent HCPs to deliver high quality writing that is scientifically rigorous, patient focused, and in line with the strategic positioning of the pharmaceutical or medical devices products.

Our work includes rigorous systematic literature reviews that our Statisticians often use to conduct meta-analyses and network meta-analyses, therefore Analysts in this team work together with our Statisticians to provide seamless scientific and technical support to our clients. We also work on more creative and pragmatic evidence reviews to inform clients’ strategic decisions with regard to clinical development or market access. You will gain a thorough understanding of how to conduct various kinds of evidence review from searching to interpretation of statistical results and ensuring that the reviews conform to industry guidelines where applicable. You will also be involved in writing up the methods and results of the reviews and statistical analyses into engaging reports, slide sets and often congress/journal publications.', 'Market Access: Market access supports timely patient access to drugs and devices, involving the assessment of clinical efficacy and safety alongside costs to determine the value of a therapy within a specific disease area. Market access activities are targeted at a wide range of stakeholders who are instrumental to the successful funding and uptake of novel therapies, such as government bodies, payers, health technology appraisal (HTA) agencies, HCPs, and patients. Our Market Access team supports a wide range of clients in producing materials to demonstrate both the clinical and economic value of some of the newest, most innovative technologies in development. Our work is multidisciplinary, often beginning with evidence generation in the form of literature reviews, advisory boards with clinicians and payers, or economic modelling, to inform the development of materials that present an evidence-based account of the product’s value in a compelling and accessible manner. Analysts working across our Market Access services support a diverse range of value and access, HTA and health economics projects. These include developing product value messages and materials (e.g. brochures, slidesets, white papers, etc.), building health economic tools and models, and developing dossiers for submission to HTA agencies.
